% asymptotic theory of multiscale regression analysis is not currently
% developed; however, we can use something called surrogation analysis in
% order construct confidence. In particular, we will make use of the
% iterated amplitude adjusted Fourier transform in order to construct
% shuffled copies of the original time series. This form of surrogate is
% appropriate for both multifractal analysis and fractal regression because
% it maintains the same power spectrum and autocorrelation as the original
% time series, while shuffling the Fourier phases. 

% This is relevant for the multifractal analysis because it
% shuffles the Fourier phases, effectively breaking any nonlinear 
% connections across time scales. This is relevant for fractal regression
% because local nonstationarities can lead to spurious correlations.
% Surrogation analysis allows us to generate. Hence, we can construct
% empirical confidence intervals for hypothesis testing while controlling
% for spurious relationships. We demonstrate the method using the simulated
% example above

% Our interest in constructing 95% confidence intervals. Hence, we will
% need at least 40 surrogates (e.g., 1/40 = 0.025, 39/40 = 0.975). 
n_surrogates = 40;

% construct n_surrogates total surrogates for each input signal
surrogate_x = iaaft(x, n_surrogates);
surrogate_y = iaaft(y, n_surrogates);

% allocate memory to store the surrogate scale-wise regression coefficients
beta_surrogates = zeros(length(s), n_surrogates);

% perform MRA on each pair of the surrogate time series. Note each
% surrogate pair corresponds to the original x and y series constructed
% above.
for i = 1:n_surrogates
    [~, ~ , ~, ~, beta_surrogates(:,i)] = mra(surrogate_x(:,i), surrogate_y(:,i),... 
    order, mins, maxs, scale_ratio, overlap);
end

% construct 95% confidence intervals as the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles at
% each scale, s. Hence we will ultimately have length(s) confidence intervals in all, one
% for each of the original beta(s) estimated in Section !
surrogate_cis = zeros(length(s),2);
for i = 1:length(s)
   surrogate_cis(i,:) = quantile(beta_surrogates(i,:), [0.025 0.975]); 
end

% add confidence intervals to the graph of beta(s). This permits us to test
% the statistical significance at each scale of beta(s) at each scale, s.
% the graph is a bit jumpy; however, we can create loess smoothed versions
% to address that issue. If the beta(s) curve is also noisy, a loess curve
% can be used to understand the general trend. Uncomment the follow lines
% to plot CIs without smoothing. 

% subplot(2,2,4)
% plot(s, surrogate_cis(:,1), '-k');
% plot(s, surrogate_cis(:,2), '-k');

% for this example, the key things to note are that he confidence intervals
% (1) contain zero everywhere, suggesting that we have successfully
% elimiated any spurious correlation between surrogate time series, and (2)
% none of the beta(s) from the intact series fall within the confidence
% intervals of the surrogates. Thus, we can reject the null hypothesis that
% that the observed multiscale relationships result from spurious
% correlation produced from autocorrelation present in each time series.

% Note that this is not the only pattern we can observe. In the next
% example, we examine the correlation between COP velocity in the
% anterioposterior and mediolateral directions. The idea here is that
% control processes responsible for maintaining upright posture should be
% related.

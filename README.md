Abstract:
In movement science, time series data are often noisy. For example, spatiotemporal parameters measured while walking or maintaining upright posture often vary considerably over several minutes of observation. Traditional linear statistics such as the mean and standard deviation often fail to capture these time varying properties. A key feature of biological signals such as heart rate, neural activity, and human walking is that they entail coordination across many timescales. These scales range from milliseconds (I.e., Neurons) to the multiple minutes that make up bouts of walking. Thus, analytical methods capable of addressing the multiscale nature of human movement and physiological data are needed. One class of methods, collectively known as multifractal analysis, is naturally suited to complete this task. This workshop will introduce fractal theory and their relevance to human locomotion and posture research. In addition, workshop attendees will be provided with hands-on instruction to apply the best practices of multifractal and nonlinear methods using MATLAB. Upon workshop completion, participants will acquire (1) a deeper understanding of the underlying mathematics and theory on multifractals in movement science, (2) software for performing analyses on their own data, and (3) knowledge of best practices for multifractal analysis in research. Workshop attendees are strongly encouraged to bring their own data to maximize learning during the workshop; however, example datasets will also be provided. The only prerequisites are college level algebra and a basic proficiency with MATLAB. Participants of all backgrounds including researchers, clinicians, and students of all levels are encouraged to attend.
